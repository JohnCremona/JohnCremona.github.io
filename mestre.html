<title>A Mestre-style search for high-rank curves of low conductor</title>

<h1 align="center">A Mestre-style search for high-rank curves of
small conductor</h1>

<h3>Method 1: The basic idea (inspired by [AB99])</h3>

<p>Let P(x) be a polynomial of degree 8. We can compute,
essentially by linear algebra, a polynomial Q(x) of degree 4 such
that Q(x)<sup>2</sup> - P(x) = R(x) for R of degree at most three.
Assume R has degree precisely three, changing P if it doesn't.</p>

<p>Now, if t is a root of P(x), we have Q(t)<sup>2</sup> = R(t),
so the equation y<sup>2</sup>=R(t) has a point [t,Q(t)]. By
writing P(x) = (x-u<sub>1</sub>)(x-u<sub>2</sub>)...(x-u<sub>8</sub>),
we can easily arrange for it to have eight rational roots, which
means that y<sup>2</sup>=R(t) is an elliptic curve with at least
eight rational points. And there is no a priori reason for these
points not to be independent, so (reducing everything to a
minimal model, and then computing height pairings or using some
cleverer way of picking an independent subset out of a set of
points) we can compute the rank of the subgroup of the Mordell
group of the curve generated by those points, and we expect quite
large values.</p>

<p>In fact, we find that we can frequently get rank 7 (for
example for <strong>u</strong> = [0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13]) --
which can be explained by noticing that you get the same minimal
model if you perform an affine transform on the points, so we can
insist that u<sub>1</sub>=0, that the u<sub>i</sub> are integers,
and that they are in increasing order, without loss of generality.</p>

<h3>Method 2: First refinement - look for extra points on the
cubic</h3>

<p>The algebra above guarantees that there are at least eight
rational points on y<sup>2</sup>=R(t), but there's no reason for
there not to be more. So we can conduct a quick search for
rational points before proceeding to the minimal model and
reducing; experimentally, this can increase the rank by up to 4.
For example, <strong>u</strong> = [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 13, 16, 18] has
seven independent rational points from the construction, but a
search on the cubic reveals 11.</p>

<h3>Method 3: Why not use a quartic?</h3>

<p>A curve of the form y<sup>2</sup> = quartic(x) possessing a
rational point is an elliptic curve. So we could take a
polynomial of degree 10, follow the polynomial-square-root
technique of method 1 to get a quartic remainder with at least 10
rational points, search for extra points, and <em>then</em>
convert to a minimal model and proceed. This requires code for
converting y<sup>2</sup> = quartic to some sort of cubic form,
which I've written following [IC92]. We get 'natural' (IE without
looking for extra points on the quartic) rank-9 curves, for
example from <strong>u</strong> = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11,
12, 13], and putting in the search for extra points gets the rank
up to 10. The intermediate stages involve quite large numbers, so
this algorithm is not especially fast.</p>

<h3>Method 4: take advantage of coincidences (inspired by the
second construction in [JFM91])</h3>

<p>If we started with a polynomial of degree 12, method 1 would
give us a y^2=quintic curve with many rational points. But it's
entirely possible that, by a strange coincidence, the x^5
coefficient of the quintic is zero, giving us a quartic and
letting us proceed in the same way as method 3. And checking
whether the x^5 coefficient is zero is very quick.</p>

<p>Mestre in [JFM91] uses a similar idea but in an algebraic
context, and constructs a whole family of y^2=quartic curves with
'general' rank 11; I attempt to describe the construction <a
href="mestre-for-dummies.htm">here</a>. Searching for points on
the quartics can increase the rank up to 13.</p>

<h3>The software</h3>

<p>I've implemented all of this in a Pari program <a
href="mestre.gp">mestre.gp</a>. The main functions are</p>

<ul>
    <li>mestreA([u1,u2,u3,u4,u5,u6,u7,u8]) performs the algorithm
        of Method 1, and returns a four-component vector : [m,
        conductor, minimal model, list of m independent points on
        the curve].</li>
    <li>mestreB([u1,u2,u3,u4,u5,u6,u7,u8]) performs the algorithm
        of Method 2 (IE the same as mestreA but with the
        intermediate search for extra points on the cubic), with
        output in the same format.</li>
    <li>mestreC([u1 .. u10]) implements method 3.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some auxiliary functions which might be useful in other
contexts are</p>

<ul>
    <li>ptslst(P) finds some rational points on y<sup>2</sup>=P(x)</li>
    <li>ellliset(E,[points]) finds a linearly-independent subset
        of the given set of points on E</li>
    <li>ell_from_quart(Q,[points]) takes a quartic polynomial and
        a set of points, computes a model for the elliptic curve
        represented by Q, and transforms the points to that model.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation notes</h3>

<ul>
    <li>For methods 1 and 2, there's no guarantee that R(x) will
        actually be a cubic, and if it turns out to be quadratic
        then the Pari elliptic-curve routines will complain that
        the curve is singular. So, before you call ellinit(), be
        sure that R(x) is a genuine cubic.</li>
    <li>For method 3, an annoying failure mode occurs if R(x) is
        the square of a quadratic -- so do an irreducibility test
        before proceeding.</li>
    <li>It's easy (using the Pari forvec command) to apply
        mestreB to thousands of <strong>u</strong> vectors and
        look for low conductors; the records I have are (searching
        for u8&lt;=21, which takes about 48 hours on a P2/350)<br>
