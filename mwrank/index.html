<h2><tt>mwrank</tt> and <tt>eclib</tt></h2> 

<p>
<tt>mwrank</tt> is a program written in <tt>C++</tt> for computing
Mordell-Weil groups of elliptic curves over <b>Q</b> via 2-descent.
It is available as source code in the <tt>eclib</tt> package, which
may be distributed under the <a href="gpl-2.0.txt">GNU General Public
  License, version 2</a>, or any later version.
</p>
<p>
<tt>mwrank</tt> is now only distributed as part
of <tt>eclib</tt>.   <tt>eclib</tt> is also included in 
Sage, and for most potential users the 
easiest way to run <tt>mwrank</tt> is to install Sage  (which also of course
gives 
you much much more).  I no longer provide a source code distribution
of <tt>mwrank</tt> 
by itself: use <tt>eclib</tt> instead.
</p>
<p>
Full source code for <tt>eclib</tt> is
available from <a
href="https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib">github</a>
Also archived at
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.593635">
  <img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.593625.svg" alt="DOI"></a>:
 this link should  go to the latest release.
</p>
<p>
Documentation for <tt>eclib</tt>, including
<tt>mwrank</tt> and modular symbol programs, is included in the
distribution.  Installation should be as easy as unpacking followed by
"./configure; make; make check; make install".
</p>



<h3> Dependencies </h3>
<p>
To build <tt>eclib</tt> from the source code you must
have Shoup's <A HREF="http://www.shoup.net/ntl/">NTL</A>
library installed on your computer, and
the <a href="http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/">PARI library</a>.
The PARI library is only used for integer factorization.
</p>
<p>
Some eclib linear algebra functions will benefit from
having <A HREF="http://www.flintlib.org/">FLINT</A> installed, but at present
using FLINT is optional.  It is not relevant for <tt>mwrank</tt> itself.
</p>
<p>
Neither <a href="http://gmplib.org/">gmp</a>
nor <a href="http://www.mpir.org/">mpir</a> is a dependency of eclib, though
most installations of NTL and PARI will use one of these.
</p>
<p>
Since April
2012, <tt>eclib</tt> uses the GNU autotools build system which should allow it
to be configured, built and installed on a wide variety of architectures
(including all those on which Sage is supported).

Various <a

programs</a>, many of which are now redundant having been incorporated
into recent Magma releases.

Various <a

scripts</a> for elliptic curves including Heegner points.  Almost all of this
is now available in the standard Pari/GP distribution since version 2.5
(version 2.6 in the case of Heegner points).
