eclib.tar.bz2 contains the complete source code for eclib
(which includes mwrank).  Download, unzip, untar and run ./configure;
make to build.  See the README file in the package for more details.

The subdirectories used to contain binaries (executables) for various
architectures, but I no longer distribute these.

For most users, I recommend just using Sage which has all of eclib in it.
