This directory contains (a) some very old executables for DOS, which
should not be used (suffix .exe.old).  (b) zip files containing more
recent versions for DOS/Windows, kindly provided by Tom Womack.  I no
longer do any programming on DOS or Windows machines, so please
contact Tom at tom@womack.net for any queries regarding these, which
were built from the source files as of May 2000.

should work on any Windows computer, win32-P6.zip should run a bit
faster on Pentium2 and Pentium3 machines. It's possible that some
libraries are missing - both my machines have quite a lot of
development tools on them, and so perhaps some libraries which aren't
universally distributed."

WARNING added November 2003:

The Windows programs here may be used as is, but there have been a lot
of bug fixes and improvements to the code since they were built, and
some of the features in the general readme files will not apply to
these versions.  I really don't want to hear about bugs in these
versions, unless the same bad behaviour also occurs with the current
unix versions (in which case the information about the Windows version
is redundant anyway!).

If I find someone willing to compile a current mwrank on Windows then
I will, of course, provide it here.
