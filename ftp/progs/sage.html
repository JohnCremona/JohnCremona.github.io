News:  From November 2007 I am no longer regularly maintaining the mwrank
distribution as a separate package.  If you want to run mwrank, it is
recommended that you install Sage.  Otherwise
see <a href="../../mwrank/index.html">here</a> for the latest version of mwrank
available as a separate package.
</p>

<p>
Depending on what you're doing, if you would like to use mwrank in
OS X, Linux, or Microsoft 
Windows, <a href="http://sage.math.washington.edu/sage">downloading
Sage</a> is another alternative.  As of sage-1.4, 
<a href="http://sage.math.washington.edu/sage">Sage</a> 
includes the mwrank build and builds of all the extra programs, e.g., tmrank,
findinf, etc., so they are available from sage by typing at a command-line
prompt, e.g.,
<pre>
     sage -mwrank (+options as needed)
</pre>
<a href="http://sage.math.washington.edu/sage">Sage</a>, 
builds the component programs of
mwrank against a shared version of the mwrank, NTL, and PARI
libraries, so the binaries are smaller and should load more quickly (if
loaded repeatedly).  Also,
<a href="http://sage.math.washington.edu/sage">Sage</a> is designed
to be easy to build from source on a wide range of platforms,
so if you're having problems building mwrank because of missing
dependencies, try building 
<a href="http://sage.math.washington.edu/sage">Sage</a>
which includes all dependencies, e.g., NTL, PARI, etc. 
</p>

<p>On Linux getting shared versions of the above-mentioned libraries
wasn't too hard; under OS X it was pretty tricky. 
Also, on Intel OS X, as of October 2006,
<a href="http://sage.math.washington.edu/sage">Sage</a>
is still the only system that ships a
version of MPIR (and hence PARI) that is compiled with assembly
language optimization, so it's often 3 times faster at big integer
arithmetic.  So, especially for OS X, you might get a better
environment in which to run the mwrank programs by getting
<a href="http://sage.math.washington.edu/sage">Sage</a>.  
There is also the advantage that one can access the elliptic
curve database and mwrank both from a single interpreter interface.
