Addenda and Errata to ANTS 7 article 

	 The elliptic curve database for conductors to 130000

as of 31 July 2006

Page numbers refer to the printed edition which starts on page 11.

1. Page 20, under Magma: Version 2.13 (late July 2006) has all the
   curves of conductors up to 130000 so LargestConductor(ECDB) now
   returns 130000 and NumberOfCurves(ECDB) gives 845960.

2. Page 23, Fig.1: The percentages in the pie chart are correct to
   120000, but to 130000 should be replaced by:

   rank 0: 38.22%   rank 1: 50.75%   rank 2: 10.87%   rank 3:  0.16%

   These were given correctly at the conference.

3. Page 25: the penultimate paragraph of section 3.4 should read

   At the other extreme, the minimal height of a generator is for
   curve $3990v1=[1,1,1,-125615,61201397]$, whose generator
   $(7107,-602054)$ has canonical height~$0.0089$.

4. Page 26, Table 4: for C_16 read C_2 x C_8.  Same for slide #26.

5. Page 27, Table 5: OK in the proceedings but on slide #29 the
   figures were given as for N<120000 (approximately).

6. Page 27, Theorem 1: Everything from "except for the following
   cases" can be deleted, as reported at the conference.
