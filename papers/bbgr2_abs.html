<h1>Black Box Galois Representations</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
We develop methods to study $2$-dimensional $2$-adic Galois
representations $\rho$ of the absolute Galois group of a number
field $K$, unramified outside a known finite set of primes $S$ of $K$,
which are presented as <I>Black Box</I> representations, where we
only have access to the characteristic polynomials of Frobenius
automorphisms at a finite set of primes.  Using suitable finite test
sets of primes, depending only on $K$ and $S$, we show how to
determine the determinant $\det\rho$, whether or not $\rho$ is
residually reducible, and further information about the size of the
<i>isogeny graph</i> of $\rho$ whose vertices are homothety classes
of stable lattices.  The methods are illustrated with examples for
$K=\mathbb{Q}$, and for $K$ imaginary quadratic, $\rho$ being the
representation attached to a Bianchi modular form.
