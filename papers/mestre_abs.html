<h1>On a theorem of Mestre and Schoof</h1>
<h2>J. E. Cremona, Andrew V. Sutherland</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
A well known theorem of Mestre and Schoof implies that the
order of an elliptic curve $E$ over a prime field $\mathbb{F}_q$ can be
uniquely determined by computing the orders of points on $E$ and its
quadratic twist, provided that $q>229$.  We extend this result to all
finite fields with $q>49$, and all prime fields with $q>29$.
