<h1>Unimodular Integer Circulants</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
We study families of integer circulant matrices, and methods for
determining which are unimodular.  This problem arises in the study of
cyclically presented groups, and leads to the following problem
concerning polynomials with integer coefficients: given a
polynomial $f(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$: determine all those $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such
that Res$(f(x),x^n-1)=\pm1$.  In this paper we describe methods for
resolving this problem, including a method based on the use of
Strassman's Theorem on $p$-adic power series, which are effective in
many cases.  The methods are illustrated with examples arising in the
study of cyclically presented groups and further examples which
illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the methods for polynomials
of higher degree.
