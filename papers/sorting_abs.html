<h1>Sorting and labelling integral ideals
in a number field</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
We define a scheme for labelling and ordering integral ideals of
number fields, including prime ideals as a special case.  The order we
define depends only on the choice of a monic irreducible integral
defining polynomial for each field $K$, and we start by defining for
each field its unique reduced defining polynomial, after Belabas.  We
define a total order on the set of prime ideals of $K$ and then extend
this to a total order on the set of all nonzero integral ideals of
$K$.  This order allows us to give a unique label of the form $N.i$,
where $N$ is its norm and $i$ is the index of the ideal in the ordered
list of all ideals of norm $N$.  Our ideal labelling scheme has
several nice properties: for a given norm, prime ideals always appear
first, and given the factorisation of the norm, the bijection between
ideals of norm $N$ and labels is computable in polynomial time.

<p>
Our motivation for this is to have a well-defined and concise way to
sort and label ideals for use in databases such as the LMFDB.  We have
implemented algorithms which realise this scheme, in Sage, Magma and
Pari.
