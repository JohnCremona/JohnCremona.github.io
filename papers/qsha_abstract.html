<h1>The analytic order of $&#1064;$  for modular elliptic curves</h1>
<h2>J. E. Cremona</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
In this note we extend the computations described in <i>Algorithms for
    modular elliptic curves</i> (1992) by computing the analytic order
    of the Tate-Shafarevich group $&#1064;$ for all the curves in each
    isogeny class; in <i>Algorithms for modular elliptic curves</i> we
    considered the strong Weil curve only.  While no new methods are
    involved here, the results have some interesting features
    suggesting ways in which strong Weil curves may be distinguished
    from other curves in their isogeny class.
