<h1>The L-functions and modular forms database project</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
The Langlands Programme, formulated by Robert Langlands in the 1960s
and since much developed and refined, is a web of interrelated theory
and conjectures concerning many objects in number theory, their
interconnections, and connections to other fields. At the heart of the
Langlands Programme is the concept of an L-function.

<p>
The most famous L-function is the Riemann zeta-function, and as well
as being ubiquitous in number theory itself, L-functions have
applications in mathematical physics and cryptography. Two of the
seven Clay Mathematics Million Dollar Millennium Problems, the Riemann
Hypothesis and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, deal with
their properties. Many different mathematical objects are connected in
various ways to L-functions, but the study of those objects is highly
specialized, and most mathematicians have only a vague idea of the
objects outside their specialty and how everything is related. Helping
mathematicians to understand these connections was the motivation for
the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB) project. Its
mission is to chart the landscape of L-functions and modular forms in
a systematic, comprehensive and concrete fashion. This involves
developing their theory, creating and improving algorithms for
computing and classifying them, and hence discovering new properties
of these functions, and testing fundamental conjectures.

In the lecture I gave a very brief introduction to L-functions for
non-experts, and explained and demonstrated how the large collection
of data in the LMFDB is organized and displayed, showing the
interrelations between linked objects, through our website
<a href="www.lmfdb.org">www.lmfdb.org</a>.
I also showed how this has been created by a world-wide
open source collaboration, which we hope may become a model for
others.
