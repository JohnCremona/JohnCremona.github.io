<h1>Numerical evidence for the Birch Swinnerton-Dyer Conjectures</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
The Birch Swinnerton-Dyer Conjectures assert a link between two
invariants of elliptic curves, one algebraic and one analytic.
Despite 50 years of effort, some partial results of breathtaking
ingenuity (and difficulty) and a prize of a million follars offered by
the Clay Mathenatics Institute, the conjectures remain wide open in
general.  Even to verify the conjectures for individual curves is a
non-trivial task which relies on deep theoretical results: how do you
verify a formula predicting the order of a group when you can neither
prove that the group is finite, nor that the number giving the
conjectural order is even rational?

<p>
In the talk, which will assume no prior knowledge of the subject, I
will describe the conjectures, what is known, and report on some
large-scale numerical evidence for over 1.4 million curves.
