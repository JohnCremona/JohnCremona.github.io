<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
We show that the proportion of plane cubic curves over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ that have
a $\mathbb{Q}_p$-rational point is a rational function in $p$, where the
rational function is independent of $p$, and we determine this rational
function explicitly. As a consequence, we obtain the density of plane cubic
curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ that have points everywhere locally; numerically, this
density is shown to be $\approx97.3\%$.
