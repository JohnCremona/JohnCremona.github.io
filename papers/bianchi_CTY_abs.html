<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
Let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field and let $\mathcal{O}_K$ be its
ring of integers. For an integral ideal $\mathfrak{n}$ of
$\mathcal{O}_K$, let $\Gamma_0({\mathfrak{n}})$ be the congruence
subgroup of level ${\mathfrak{n}}$ consisting of matrices in
GL${\mathcal{O}_K}$ that are upper triangular mod ${\mathfrak{n}}$. In
this paper, we discuss techniques to compute the space of Bianchi
modular forms of level $\Gamma_0({\mathfrak{n}})$ as a Hecke module in
the case where $K$ has arbitrary class group.  Our algorithms and
computations extend and complement that carried out for fields of
class number $1$, $2$, and $3$ by the first author, and by his
students Bygott and Lingham in unpublished theses.  We give details
and several examples for $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-17})$, whose class group
is cyclic of order $4$, including a proof of modularity of an elliptic
curve over this field. We also give an overview of the results
obtained for a wide range of imaginary quadratic fields, which are
tabulated in the L-functions and modular forms database
(<a href="https://www.lmfdb.org/">LMFDB</a>).
