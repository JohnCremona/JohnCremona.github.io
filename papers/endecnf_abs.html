<h1>
Computing the endomorphism ring of an elliptic curve over a number field</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
We describe deterministic and probabilistic algorithms to determine
whether or not a given monic irreducible polynomial $H\in
\mathbb{Z}Z[X]$ is a Hilbert class polynomial, and if so, which one.
These algorithms can be used to determine whether a given algebraic
integer is the $j$-invariant of an elliptic curve with complex
multiplication (CM), and if so, the associated CM discriminant.
More generally, given an elliptic curve~$E$ over a number field, one
can use them to compute the endomorphism ring of $E$.
Our algorithms admit simple implementations that are asymptotically
and practically faster than existing approaches.
