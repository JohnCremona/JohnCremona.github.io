<h1>
On Elliptic Curves of prime power conductor over imaginary
  quadratic fields with class number one</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
The main result of this paper is to extend from $\mathbb{Q}$ to each of the
nine imaginary quadratic fields of class number one a result of Serre
(1987) and Mestre-Oesterl\'e (1989), namely that if $E$ is an elliptic
curve of prime conductor then either $E$ or a $2$-, $3$- or
$5$-isogenous curve has prime discriminant.  For four of the nine
fields, the theorem holds with no change, while for the remaining five
fields the discriminant of a curve with prime conductor is (up to
isogeny) either prime or the square of a prime.  The proof is
conditional in two ways: first that the curves are modular, so are
associated to suitable Bianchi newforms; and second that a certain
level-lowering conjecture holds for Bianchi newforms.  We also
classify all elliptic curves of prime power conductor and non-trivial
torsion over each of the nine fields: in the case of $2$-torsion, we
find that such curves either have CM or with a small finite number of
exceptions arise from a family analogous to the Setzer-Neumann family
over $\mathbb{Q}$.
