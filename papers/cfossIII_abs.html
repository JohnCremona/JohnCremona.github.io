<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
This is the third in a series of papers in which we study the $n$-Selmer group
of 
an elliptic curve, with the aim of representing its elements as curves of
degree $n$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$. The methods we describe are practical in the
case $n=3$ for elliptic curves over the rationals, and have been implemented in
 MAGMA.

<p>
  One important ingredient of our work is an algorithm for 
  trivialising central simple algebras. This is of independent interest:
  for example, it could be used for parametrising Brauer-Severi surfaces.
