<h1>Global methods for the symplectic type of congruences between
elliptic curves</h1>
<h2>J. E. Cremona, Nuno Freitas</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
We describe a systematic investigation into the existence of
congruences between the mod $p$ torsion modules of elliptic curves
defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, including methods to determine the symplectic type
of such congruences. We classify the existence and symplectic type of
mod $p$ congruences between twisted elliptic curves over number
fields, giving global symplectic criteria that apply in situations
where the available local methods may fail.

We report on the results of applying our methods for all primes
$p\ge7$ to the elliptic curves in the LMFDB database, which currently
includes all elliptic curves of conductor less than ${500000}$.  We
also show that while such congruences exist for each $p\le17$, there
are none for $p \geq 19$ in the database, in line with a strong form
of the Frey-Mazur conjecture.
