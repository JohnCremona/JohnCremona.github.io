<h1>Congruence subgroups, cusps and Manin symbols over number fields</h1>
<h2>J. E. Cremona, M. T. Aranes</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
We develop an explicit theory of congruence subgroups,
  their cusps, and Manin symbols for arbitrary number fields.  While
  our motivation is in the application to the theory of modular
  symbols over imaginary quadratic fields, we give a general treatment
  which makes no special assumptions on the number field.
