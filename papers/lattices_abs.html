<h1>
Lattice coverings and homogeneous covering congruences</h1>
<h2>John E. Cremona and Peter Koymans</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
We consider the problem of covering $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with a finite number of
sublattices of finite index, satisfying a simple minimality or
non-degeneracy condition.  We show how this problem may be viewed as a
projective (or homogeneous) version of the well-known problem of
covering systems of congruences. We give a construction of minimal
coverings which produces many, but not all, minimal coverings, and
determine all minimal coverings with at most 8 sublattices.
