<h1>Reduction of binary forms over imaginary quadratic fields</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
We show how the classical theory of reduction of real binary
forms with respect to the action of SL$(2,\mathbb{Z})$ may be extended to a
reduction theory for binary forms with complex coefficients under the
action of certain discrete groups. In particular, we give some
explicit results concerning the reduction of binary cubics and
quartics with coefficients in the ring of integers of an imaginary
quadratic field of class number one (such as $\mathbb{Z}$[i]), and mention
applications to the enumeration of cubic fields and two-descent on
elliptic curves.
