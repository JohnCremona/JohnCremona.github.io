<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
In this paper we consider the proportion of genus one curves over $\mathbb{Q}$
of the form $z^2=f(x,y)$ where $f(x,y)\in\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$ is a binary quartic
form (or more generally of the form $z^2+h(x,y)z=f(x,y)$ where also
$h(x,y)\in\mathbb{Z}[x,y]$ is a binary quadratic form) that have points
everywhere locally. We show that the proportion of these curves that are locally
soluble, computed as a product of local densities, is approximately
75.96%.  We prove that the local density at a prime $p$ is given by a
fixed degree-$9$ rational function of $p$ for all odd $p$ (and for the
generalised equation, the same rational function gives the local
density at every prime).  An additional analysis is carried out to
estimate rigorously the local density at the real place.
