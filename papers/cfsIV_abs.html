<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
In this paper we consider models for genus one curves of degree $n$
for $n=2$, $3$ and $4$, which arise in explicit $n$-descent on
elliptic curves.  We prove theorems on the existence of minimal models
with the same invariants as the minimal model of the Jacobian elliptic
curve and provide simple algorithms for minimising a given model,
valid over general number fields.  Finally, for genus one models
defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, we develop a theory of reduction and again give
explicit algorithms for $n=2$, $3$ and $4$.
