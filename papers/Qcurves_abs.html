<h1>
$\mathbb{Q}$-curves over odd degree number fields</h1>
<h2>John Cremona, Filip Najman</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
By reformulating and extending results of Elkies, we prove some
results on $\mathbb{Q}$-curves over number fields of odd degree. We show that,
over such fields, the only prime isogeny degrees $\ell$ which an
elliptic curve without CM may have are those degrees which are already
possible over $\mathbb{Q}$ itself (in particular, $\ell\le37$), and we show
the existence of a bound on the degrees of cyclic isogenies between
$\mathbb{Q}$-curves depending only on the degree of the field.  We also prove
that the only possible torsion groups of $\mathbb{Q}$-curves over number
fields of degree not divisible by a prime $\ell\leq 7$ are the $15$
groups that appear as torsion groups of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$.
Complementing these theoretical results we
give an algorithm for establishing whether any given elliptic curve
$E$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-curve, which involves working only over $\mathbb{Q}(j(E))$.
