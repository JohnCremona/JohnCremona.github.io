<h1>Local and global densities
for Weierstrass models of elliptic curves
</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
We prove local results on the $p$-adic density of elliptic curves over
$\mathbb{Q}_p$ with different reduction types, together with global results on
densities of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with specified reduction types
at one or more (including infinitely many) primes.  These global
results include: the density of integral Weierstrass equations which
are minimal models of semistable elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ (that is,
elliptic curves with square-free conductor) is
$1/\zeta(2)\approx60.79\%$, the same as the density of square-free
integers; the density of semistable elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ is
$\zeta(10)/\zeta(2)\approx60.85\%$; the density of integral
Weierstrass equations which have square-free discriminant is
$\prod_p\left(1-\frac{2}{p^2}+\frac{1}{p^3}\right) \approx 42.889\%$,
which is the same (except for a different factor at the prime $2$) as
the density of monic integral cubic polynomials with square-free
discriminant (and agrees with a previous result of Baier and Browning
for short Weierstrass equations); and the density of elliptic curves
over $\mathbb{Q}$ with square-free minimal discriminant is
$\zeta(10)\prod_p\left(1-\frac{2}{p^2}+\frac{1}{p^3}\right)\approx42.93\%$.

The local results derive from a detailed analysis of Tate's Algorithm,
while the global ones are obtained through the use of the Ekedahl
Sieve, as developed by Poonen, Stoll, and Bhargava.
