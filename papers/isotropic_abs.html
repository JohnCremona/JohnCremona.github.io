<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
We show that the density of quadratic forms in $n$ variables over
$\mathbb{Z}_p$ that are isotropic is a rational function of $p$, where the
rational function is independent of $p$, and we determine this
rational function explicitly.  When real quadratic forms in $n$
variables are distributed according to the Gaussian Orthogonal
Ensemble (GOE) of Random Matrix Theory, we determine explicitly the
probability that a random
such real quadratic form is isotropic (i.e., indefinite).

As a consequence, for each $n$, we determine an exact expression for
the probability that a random {integral} quadratic form in $n$
variables is isotropic (i.e., has a nontrivial zero over $\mathbb{Z}$), when
these integral quadratic forms are chosen according to the GOE distribution.
In particular, we find an exact expression for the probability
that a random integral quaternary quadratic form is isotropic;
numerically this probability of isotropy is approximately $98.3\%$.
