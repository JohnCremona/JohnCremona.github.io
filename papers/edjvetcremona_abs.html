<h1>Cyclically Presented Groups and Resultants</h1>
<h2>J. E. Cremona, M. Edjvet</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
We consider the family of irreducible cyclically presented groups
on~$n$ generators whose generating word (in the standard rewrite) has
length at most $15$.  Using the software packages KBMAG, quotpic
and Magma, together with group and number theoretic methods, we show
that if $6\le n\le100$ then the group is non-trivial. In an appendix
we list the 47 cases within $2 \leq n \leq 100$ for which we know
the group to be trivial, and 27 further cases for which triviality has
yet to be determined.
