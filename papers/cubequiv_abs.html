<h1>
On the equivalence of binary cubic forms</h1>
<h2>John Cremona</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
We consider the question of determining whether two binary cubic forms
over an arbitrary field $K$ whose characteristic is not $2$ or $3$ are
equivalent under the actions of either GL$(2,K)$ or SL$(2,K)$,
deriving two necessary and sufficient criteria for such equivalence in
each case. One of these involves an algebraic invariant of binary
cubic forms which we call the Cardano invariant, which is closely
connected to classical formulas and also appears in the work of
Bhargava {\it et al.}. The second criterion is expressed in terms of
the base field itself, and also gives explicit matrices in SL$(2,K)$
or GL$(2,K)$ transforming one cubic into the other, if any exist, in
terms of the coefficients of bilinear factors of a bicovariant of the
two cubics.  We also consider automorphisms of a single binary cubic
form, show how to use our results to test equivalence of binary cubic
forms over an integral domain such as $\mathbb{Z}$, and briefly recall some
connections between binary cubic forms and the arithmetic of elliptic
curves.

The methods used are elementary, and similar to those used in our
earlier work with Fisher concerning equivalences between binary
quartic forms.
