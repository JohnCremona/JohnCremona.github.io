<h1>
On the equivalence of binary cubic forms</h1>
<h2>John Cremona</h2>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
We consider the question of determining whether two binary cubic forms
over an arbitrary field $K$ whose characteristic is not $2$ or $3$ are
equivalent under the actions of either GL$(2,K)$ or SL$(2,K)$,
deriving two necessary and sufficient criteria for such equivalence in
each case. One of these involves an algebraic invariant of binary
cubic forms, closely connected to classical formulas, which we call
the Cardano invariant; this also appears in the work of Bhargava <i>
    et al.</i>.
The second criterion also gives explicit matrices
in SL$(2,K)$ or GL$(2,K)$ transforming one cubic into the other, if
any exist, in terms of the coefficients of bilinear factors of a
bicovariant of the two cubics.  We also consider automorphisms of a
single binary cubic form, recovering a result of Xiao, show how to use
our results to test equivalence of binary cubic forms over an
integral domain such as $\mathbb{Z}$, and briefly recall some connections
between binary cubic forms and the arithmetic of elliptic curves.

The methods used are elementary, and similar to those used in our 2009
paper with Fisher, concerning equivalences between binary quartic
forms.
