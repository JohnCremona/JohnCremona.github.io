<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
This paper treats the following geometric problem: Given vertices
$x_1,\ldots ,x_n$ of a polyhedron in the integer lattice in $k$
dimensions, can that polyhedron be ``shrunk'' to a similar one (i.e.,
one whose sides remain in the same ratio as the original polyhedron)
while still remaining on the integer lattice.  We give a necessary
condition for this to be possible, which depends on the parity of $k$;
for $k\le4$ we show that the condition is sufficient, and we also give
algorithms to do the shrinking. In two dimensions, the algorithm only
involves computing greatest common divisors over the Gaussian integers
and is polynomial time. For $k=3$ and $4$ the algorithms involve
computing g.c.d.s in the algebra of Hurwitz quaternions.  This gives a
polynomial time algorithm for $k=4$, but because the algorithm in
three dimensions relies on determining the square factors of an
integer, it is at present exponential.  The proofs are remarkably
simple and are quite computational in nature.
