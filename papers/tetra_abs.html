<h1>Tetrahedral Elliptic Curves and the local-to-global principle for
  Isogenies</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
We study the failure of a local-global principle for the existence of
$l$-isogenies for elliptic curves over number fields $K$.  Sutherland
has shown that over $\mathbb{Q}$ there is just one failure, which occurs for
$l=7$ and a unique $j$-invariant, and has given a classification of
such failures when $K$ does not contain the quadratic subfield of the
$l$'th cyclotomic field.  In this paper we provide a classification of
failures for number fields which do contain this quadratic field, and
we find a new `exceptional' source of such failures arising from the
exceptional subgroups of $\mbox{PGL}_2(\mathbb{F}_l)$. By constructing models of two
modular curves, $X_\text{s}(5)$ and $X_{S_4}(13)$, we find two new
families of elliptic curves for which the principle fails, and we show
that, for quadratic fields, there can be no other exceptional
failures.
