<I>Summary of contents:</I> 
<OL>

<LI>Detailed description of the computation of the modular elliptic curves
of conductor N using modular symbols, as implemented by the author;

<LI>Description of algorithms for studying the arithmetic of elliptic
curves defined over Q, including Tate's algorithm for the conductor
and minimal model, determining the rank via 2-descent and the the
Mordell-Weil group, the canonical height of rational points, and the
computation of isogenies;

<LI>Tables of all modular elliptic curves of conductor less than 1000,
containing coefficients, L-series, generators, the quantities
appearing in the Birch Swinnerton-Dyer formula for the order of the
Tate-Shafarevitch group, and the degree of the modular
parametrization.

<BR>

The final text errata list for the first edition is available as a <A
HREF="FirstEdition/errata.dvi">dvi file</A> or as <A
HREF="FirstEdition/errata.tex">TeX source</A>.  Also available are a
<A HREF="FirstEdition/taberr.txt">summary</A> of the omissions in the
tables, and a supplement to the tables containing the missing data,
either as a <A HREF="FirstEdition/addenda.doc">plain text file</A> or
as a <A HREF="FirstEdition/addenda.dvi">dvi file</A>.

<P>

The <B>Second Edition</B> corrects numerous typographical errors, and
has substantial revisions of some sections, as well as a new section
and table on the degree of modular parametrizations.  It was published
in May 1997.  The following parts of the Second Edition may be viewed:
