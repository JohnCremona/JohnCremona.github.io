<p><i>Summary of contents:</i></p>
<ol>
<li>Detailed description of the computation of the modular elliptic
curves of conductor N using modular symbols, as implemented by the
author;</li>
<li>Description of algorithms for studying the arithmetic of
elliptic curves defined over Q, including Tate's algorithm for the
conductor and minimal model, determining the rank via 2-descent and
the the Mordell-Weil group, the canonical height of rational
points, and the computation of isogenies;</li>
<li>Tables of all modular elliptic curves of conductor less than
1000, containing coefficients, L-series, generators, the quantities
appearing in the Birch Swinnerton-Dyer formula for the order of the
Tate-Shafarevitch group, and the degree of the modular
parametrization.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <b>First Edition</b> was published by CUP in 1992.</p>
<p><b>Errata to the first edition</b><br>
The final text errata list for the first edition is available as a
<a href="FirstEdition/errata.dvi">dvi file</a> or as <a href=
"FirstEdition/errata.tex">TeX source</a>. Also available are a
<a href="FirstEdition/taberr.txt">summary</a> of the omissions in
the tables, and a supplement to the tables containing the missing
data, either as a <a href="FirstEdition/addenda.doc">plain text
file</a> or as a <a href="FirstEdition/addenda.dvi">dvi
file</a>.</p>
<p>The <b>Second Edition</b> corrects numerous typographical
errors, and has substantial revisions of some sections, as well as
a new section and table on the degree of modular parametrizations.
It was published in May 1997. The following parts of the Second
