<H2 align=center>Software packages useful for elliptic curve investigations</H2>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="mwrank"></A> <H3>mwrank and related programs:</H3> <UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.maths.nott.ac.uk/personal/jec/mwrank/">mwrank
home page</a> </UL>

<BR>

<LI><A NAME="magma"></A>
<H3>Magma:</H3>
<P>
Magma has a huge amount of functionality for working with elliptic
curves over <b>Q</b>, number fields, finite fields, and general fields.
</P>
<P>
It includes the database of all elliptic curves over <b>Q</b> with
conductor less than 130000 (but none of the data in the database is
made available apart from the curves themselves).
</P>

<BR>

<LI><A NAME="pari"></A>
<H3>Pari/GP:</H3>
<P>
Pari/GP has a many functions for working with elliptic curves over
<b>Q</b>, and a few fir general fields.  There are also some add-on
packages (e.g. mine for group structure over
<b>F</b><sub><i>p</i></sub> and for analytic rank).
</P>
<P>
An optional extra database has all elliptic curves of conductor up to
130000, together with ranks and generators mod torsion.
</P>

<BR>

<LI><A NAME="sage"></A>
<H3>SAGE:</H3>
<P>
Has all Pari/GP functionality and access to mwrank and my other
elliptic curve programs, but currently there is a lot not yet
available (unless you also have Magma installed)
</P>

<H2 align=center>Elliptic Curve functionality</H2>

<H3 align=left>Elliptic Curves over <b>Q</b></H3>

All the following are available, sometimes requiring the use of an
add-on external program:
<UL>
<li>basic invariants, conductors, torsion points
<li>point operations, heights and height pairing
<li>ranks, generators
<li>division polynomials
<li>L-series and analytic rank
<li>isogenies
</UL>

<H3 align=left>Associated modular forms</H3>
<ul>

<li>Magma can construct elliptic curves from (suitable!) modular
forms, and vice versa.  

<li>None of the other packages have (yet?).  

<li>My programs for computing
modular elliptic curves are not suitable for general use...

</ul>

<H3 align=left>Elliptic Curves over other fields</H3> 
<UL> 

<li>Over finite fields: Magma can do everything (order, structure,
discrete log, Weil pairing).  Pari/gp can by default only find group
order but add-ons can do the rest.  SAGE?  

<li>Over local fields: Magma, Pari/gp and SAGE can find Tate
parameters.  mwrank has some functionality for working in component
groups.  

<li> Number fields other than <b>Q</b>: Magma can find conductors,
local (and global when class number=1) minimal models, heights of
points, and ranks via 2-descent.
