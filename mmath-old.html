<h1>MMath research projects for 2013-14</h1>

<h2><font color="red">Please note: I had a large number of enquiries
 and can only take on one student for each project.  Both projects are now
    taken. </font></h2>

<h2>Project 1: normalisers of congruence subgroups</h2>
This project has now been taken up.
<p>
  A more theoretical project, involving algebra (some commutative algebra and
  some group theory) and number theory (elementary and algebraic).  Ideally you
  will have studied both commutative algebra and algebraic number theory.  If
  you were to take MA4 Modular Forms in Term 1 it would help motivate this
  project, which has application to modular forms over number fields, but that
  is not a requirement.
</p>

<p>Congruence subgroups of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ are subgroups of finite index
  defined by congruence conditions modulo a positive integer $N$.  They arise
  in the theory of modular elliptic curves, as used by Wiles in his famous
  proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.  Among these are the groups $\Gamma_0(N)$,
  consisting of matrices whose reduction modulo $N$ is upper triangular.  An
  important thing to know about these is what is their normaliser in
  $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, since normalising matrices induce useful operators on
  associated spaces of modular forms.  In the case of $\Gamma_0(N)$ the
  normaliser is known, but the complete statement is notorious for having been
  wrongly stated, or correctly stated but with an incorrect proof, in several
  papers since the 1970s.
</p>

<p>The first task for this project is to review these
  accounts and give a full and correct exposition of the result.  Secondly,
  the aim will be to extend these results to number fields, where
  $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ is replaced by $SL(2,R)$ for $R$ the ring of integers in a
  number field.  Here, some of the normalising matrices are known but the
  complete normaliser (in $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$) has never been determined.  Among
  the algebraic tools required will be knowledge of ideal class groups of
  number fields, and of the structure of projective modules over Dedekind
  Domains.  It is possible that, if the project is successful in completing the
  determination of the normalisers in some generality, that a publishable
  research paper will result from the project.
</p>

<h2>Project 2: database of elliptic curves over quadratic fields</h2>
This project has now been taken up.
<p>
A more computational project, involving elliptic curves over number fields.
You should have studied algebraic number theory, and should be planning to take
  MA4 Elliptic Curves in Term 1.
</p>

<p>
The intimate relation between elliptic curves and modular forms over
$\mathbb{Q}$ was established by Wiles in the 1990s and had as a famous
consequence the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.  Such a relation is expected to
hold over other number fields, but much less is known in this case.  The aim of
this computational project will be to systematically tabulate elliptic curves
over imaginary quadratic fields with certain properties, in order to find
curves matching existing tables of modular forms over these fields.
</p>

<p>
Some rather small tables exist over these fields, which were collated about 30
years ago.  Using current knowledge and technology it will be possible to
expand these greatly, as has already been done for just one real quadratic
field.  The fields we will be working over are the nine imaginary quadratic
fields of class number one (for example $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1})$).
</p>

<p>
As well as finding the curves the project will involve computing many of their
arithmetic properties, including the invariants which are the subject of the
Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture.  A database of all the data computed will
be added to a <a href="http://www.lmfdb.org">major online resource</a>.
</p>

<p>An essential requirement for anyone taking on this project is a desire to
  write and run computer programs;  access will be given to the number theory
  group's research machines for this purpose, as well as training in the
  specialised software components used.
